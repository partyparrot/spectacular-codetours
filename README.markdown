## How to play with it

yarn start

:octocat: :eyes:

## Why a separate app?

Spectacle slides doesn't play well with Meteor, the problem seems to come from CSS modules. I tried to add a Meteor build plugin for CSS modules but it didn't work. 

This may be because Spectacle is heavily tied to Webpack? Honestly no idea.

So I've made a separate app: this is going to be WICKED!!! :tada:
